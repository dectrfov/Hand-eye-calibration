# Hand-eye-calibration
This repository reproduces the algorithm in Finding the Kinematic Base Frame of a Robot by Hand-Eye Calibration Using 3D Position Data [paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7387789).

### Introduction
Hand-eye-calibration is used to calibrate the relationship between the camera and the robotic arm. Generally, it contains Eye-in-hand and Eye-to-hand configuration. No mater what configuration is, the formulation is written as </br>
$ AX=ZB $ </br>
Where A, B, X and Z are 4*4 matrices
